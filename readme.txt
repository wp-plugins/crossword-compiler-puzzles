== Description ==

Simple upload of interactive puzzles exported by Crossword Compiler, or conversion of puzzles already posted to the
http://crossword.info website.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin as normal, and activate it. Then when you make a post or page, click the crossword icon in the visual editor
to insert a puzzle. You can chose either to import a html and js file exported by Crossword Compiler (version 9+), or import the
puzzle from a page that already exists on crossword.info.

By default the applet files are served from a web service. To put the applet files on your server use the version of the
plugin from http://www.crossword-compiler.com/wordpress.html.
Subsequent automatic updates will continue to use the latest version of the applet files after you have used this once.
